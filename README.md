# FalmaarTools

A set of Python and C++ tools useful in everyday life.


## Installation of Python package

Current method of installation is to clone this directory and run
```bash
pip install --editable .
```


## Installation of C++ package

The C++ library is header-only, and currently consists of a single file called
`ft.hpp`. Installation can therefore consist of simply copying this header file
into a directory in the PATH environment variable, e.g. `/usr/local/include/`.
